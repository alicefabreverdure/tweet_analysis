### 0. Context

In this project, we wanted to create an application that scrap hashtags/tweets of a topic and reveal the sentiments deriving from these hashtags.

To fullfill our goals, we used streamlit to create an interface to show the sentiments of the tweet. 
The prediction of the hashtags/tweet's sentiments is made by training a model (the model is described in the modele.py file). 

We will describe here in details the steps that should be made for a perfect functionning of this application.

### 1. The application

To create the streamlit interface from python we need to install/import the following libraries:
- datetime
- pandas
- streamlit
- flair (falir.models and flair.data)
- tweepy

To define the title, background, subheadder, caption and other characteristics please check the streamlit_app.py file.

for the model we used the 'TextClassifier' model from flair library(check section 2 for details on the model).

for the preprocessing of the tweet we created a function:

```
def preprocess(text):
    return ''.join([' ' + char + ' ' if char in punct else char for char in [char for char in re.sub(r'http\S+', 'http', text, flags=re.MULTILINE) if char in allowed_chars]])[:maxlen]
```

to load the model:

```
with st.spinner('Loading classification model...'):
    classifier = TextClassifier.load('model-saves/best-model.pt')
```
and to predict with this model:

```
with st.spinner('Predicting...'):
        classifier.predict(sentence)
```

After this procedure,we show the predictions on the interface by labeling the tweet as positive or negative sentiment.

### 2. the model

In this application, we implemented a model that can predict the sentiment(positif or negatif) of a hashtag/tweet and provide its confidence level. 

In this applicaiton we build our model by implementing the different steps (labeling of the text, embedding the words and text classifying) and finally we trained our model to use it in the app.(Check details of the code in the file modele.py)

### 3. the requirements

In order to run our model, we need several dependencies.(streamlit, flair ...)

Therefor, we created 'requirements.txt' file. this file contains the libraries with their speicific version for this appplication to run.

To install these dependencies, run the following code: 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. The test using pytest

To assure that our model is functioning with no errors and good performance, we created a file 'test_streamlit_app.py'

we lunch the test by the command:

```
pytest
```
### 5. The image and container

To dockerize the app, we need to create a docker file. (assuming that you already have docker desktop)

Thus, we create a file 'Dockerfile'.(Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands needed to assemble an image).
docker build images automatically by reading the instructions from this Dockerfile.

In our case, we used python:3.10.8 as base image. (It is crucial that you update python and work with python3.10 version so the flair's library work porperly)
we created the work directory '/app' and copy the files in it.

we installed the requirements using 
```
RUN pip install requirements.txt
```

and finally we used executed the:
```
ENTRYPOINT ["streamlit", "run", "streamlit_app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]
```

 - on local docker (without docker hub), follow the description below:
```
docker build -t docker_tweet_analysis .
```

Then after building the container to run it:
```
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 docker_tweet_analysis
```

### BONUS: we put our container on dockerhub
follow the link: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/alicefabreverdure/tweet_analysis

in vscode: 
```
docker pull alicefabreverdure/tweet_analysis
```
then we create the image by:
```
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 alicefabreverdure/tweet_analysis
```
